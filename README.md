# clitracker
CLITracker is a Rust-based terminal productivity tool with an ncurses UI. It integrates with Pivotal Trackerâ€™s API to fetch, update, and manage tasks from your command line. Designed for developers who live in the terminal, it keeps you focused and efficient without switching to a browser.

## Development Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Pivotal Tracker API token.
2. Build and run the application with `cargo run`.

This project uses ncurses for a terminal UI and reqwest for interacting with the Pivotal Tracker API. The current implementation contains stub functions and a basic menu layout.
